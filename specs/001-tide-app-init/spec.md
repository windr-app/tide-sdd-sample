# Feature Specification: Tide Information Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `001-tide-app-init`  
**Created**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Tide application to view time, type (high|low), coef and day of tide over time"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interested in tide information, I want to view tide data including timing, type (high/low), coefficient, and date so that I can plan activities around tidal conditions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I access the tide application, **When** I select a specific location and date range, **Then** I should see a list of tide events with time, type (high/low), coefficient, and date
2. **Given** I am viewing tide data, **When** I look at each tide entry, **Then** I should clearly see whether it's a high tide or low tide
3. **Given** I am viewing tide information, **When** I examine the coefficient values, **Then** I should understand the strength/magnitude of each tide
4. **Given** I want to see tide patterns, **When** I view the data over time, **Then** I should be able to see the chronological sequence of tide events

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: no tide data available for selected location/time period]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: invalid date ranges or future dates beyond prediction capability]?
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: location-specific tide data is unavailable]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display tide event times in 24h format in France
- **FR-002**: System MUST clearly indicate tide type as either "high" or "low"
- **FR-003**: System MUST display tide coefficient values a integer, coming from an API or database
- **FR-004**: System MUST show the date for each tide event
- **FR-005**: System MUST present tide data in chronological order over time
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to view tide information for La Rochelle, France, for the current month
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time tide data updates at least every hour
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle user location selection via GPS and manual entry

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tide Event**: Represents a single tidal occurrence with time, type (high/low), coefficient value, and date
- **Location**: Geographic reference point for tide predictions for La Rochelle, France
- **Time Period**: Date range for viewing tide data by month
- **Coefficient**: Numerical value representing tide strength/magnitude [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scale definition and interpretation]
